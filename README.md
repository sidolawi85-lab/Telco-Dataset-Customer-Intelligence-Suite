## 🚀 Business Problem
The organization faced a critical **26.5% Churn Rate**. While acquisition volume was steady, the high attrition rate among "Month-to-Month" subscribers was creating a "leaky bucket" effect, destabilizing Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR).

**The Objective:** Build a diagnostic tool to identify high-risk segments, calculate customer health scores, and provide a strategic roadmap for retention.

## 💡 Key Features & Logic
This project goes beyond basic reporting by implementing custom business logic via **Advanced DAX**:

* **Executive Health Scoring:** Proprietary algorithms for **Growth Index (5.6/10)** and **Retention Score (7.3/10)** to provide instant executive clarity.
* **Snapshot-Aware MRR:** Reconstructed historical revenue curves from static data using time-travel DAX filters.
* **Behavioral Segmentation:** Identified the **"6-Month Churn Cliff"** using tenure distribution analysis.
* **Risk Quantification:** Calculated the financial exposure of "At-Risk" revenue to prioritize intervention spend.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Power BI:** Data Modeling, DAX Engineering, and UX/UI Design.
* **GIMP:** Professional asset creation and high-resolution export processing.
* **Excel/CSV:** Raw data source (Telco Customer Dataset).
* **n8n (In Progress):** Automated alerting workflows triggered by KPI thresholds.

---

## 📈 Strategic Insights
* **The Tenure Trap:** Customers are 4x more likely to churn in their first 6 months.
* **Contract Power:** Moving 10% of users from Monthly to 1-Year contracts yields a projected 15% increase in MRR stability.
* **Service Gap:** Fiber Optic users show the highest ARPU but the fastest churn, indicating a service-quality mismatch.
